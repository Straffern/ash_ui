defmodule AshUi.Notification.DerivedReads do
  @moduledoc """
  Subscription edges for what a rendered record DERIVES: "whatever a page
  reads, it subscribes to".

  The relationship walk in each transport adapter subscribes a page to the
  relationships actually loaded on its record. A calculation or aggregate
  the view renders reads more than that: Ash loads its dependencies as hidden
  internal loads, so those rows never appear on the record and the walk
  never sees them. This module turns the declaration-derived read set
  (`AshUi.Reload.derived_reads/2`, the same derivation the reload
  contract narrows with) into subscription edges for one loaded record:

    * the first hop of a relationship read, taken from the loaded record, is
      key-matched on `destination_attribute = record[source_attribute]` and
      carries the relationship filter with the record as `parent` — the same
      precision the relationship walk registers;
    * later hops, and aggregates over unrelated resources, have no derivable
      key and subscribe at resource level (`attrs: []`);
    * a first hop the record already has loaded, with nothing beyond it, is
      left to the walk at the root, whose reload of that relationship already
      recomputes every dependent root (`Reload.dependent_roots_for_paths/2`).

  Each edge reloads `prefix ++ [field]`: the derived value itself, recomputed
  by Ash with its hidden dependencies, instead of materializing the
  relationship on the record.
